# CMPUT 366 Intelligent Systems

This course provides an introduction to artificial intelligence, which we define as the
study and design of agents that interact with a complex, uncertain world to achieve a
goal. We will emphasize agents that can make near-optimal decisions in a timely manner
with incomplete information and limited computational resources. The course will cover
Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, planning, and function
approximation (online supervised learning). The course will take an information-
processing approach to the concept of mind and briefly touch on perspectives from
psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy.

## Course Topics
With a focus on AI as the design of agents learning from experience to predict and
control their environment, topics will include:

* Markov decision processes
* Reinforcement learning
* Planning by approximate dynamic programming
* Monte Carlo methods
* Heuristic search
* Online supervised learning
